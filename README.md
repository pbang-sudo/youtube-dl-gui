# youtube-dl-gui
A simple Python3 based YouTube downloader with Tkinter GUI.
The project was nothing more than a college project but I've added some features in it, if in future user faces any problems.
For instance
(a) This project contains a self analysing module which itself confirms the packages that are installed in the user's system that are required to run the program.
(b) It also contains a sub-scripted program that checks whether the user's machine is connected to the Internet or any other network to provide the download.

Note:
As it is a work under progress I would like to say that this projects lacks some features which would updated soon. Thank You!
