# youtube-dl-gui
A simple Python3 based YouTube downloader with Tkinter GUI.
The project was nothing more than a college project but I've added some features in it, if in future user faces any problems.
For instance:
* This project contains a self analysing GUI-module which itself checks and confirms the packages that are installed in the user's system that are required to run the program.
* It also contains a sub-scripted program that checks whether the user's machine is connected to the Internet or any other network to provide the download.

# Getting it running in your system
* must have python-3.x installed
* must have pytube, PILLOW, requests installed

# For file to run:
 `python3 main.py`

# NOTES
As it is a work under progress I would like to say that this projects lacks some features which would updated soon. Thank You!
